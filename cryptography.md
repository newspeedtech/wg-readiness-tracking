| bssl-crypto | ? | 🟢 Ready | Rust | ? | |
| Botan | >=3.6.0 | 🟢 Ready | C++ | ML-KEM, ML-DSA, SLH-DSA, HSS/LMS, XMSS, FrodoKEM, McEliece | |
| Bouncy Castle	| Java >= 1.79, C# >= 2.5.0 |	🟢 Ready | Java, C#	| ML-KEM, ML-DSA, SLH-DSA	| Full support for finalized NIST standards was added in these versions (released late 2024). |
| Conscrypt| [Commit 4b9f688](https://github.com/google/conscrypt/commit/4b9f688b241f73a89ba1eb8871b302062c1790ff)| 🟡 In Progress | Java | ML-DSA, SLH-DSA | No direct support of ML-KEM but via HPKE. Support of SLH-DSA-SHA2-128S. Supports ML-DSA-44/65/87|
| Crypto++	| N/A	| 🔴 Not Supported | C++ | None | A community fork called CryptoPP-Modern has added experimental support |
| Go crypto | [>=1.24](https://pkg.go.dev/crypto/mlkem@go1.24) | 🟢 Ready | Go | ML-KEM, ML-DSA, SLH-DSA | https://github.com/golang/go/issues/64537 |
| IDEMIA Sphere Cryptographic Library | 1.0.0 | 🟢 Ready | C, Python, Java | ML-KEM, ML-DSA, LMS, SLH-DSA | FIPS CAVP certified https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/cryptographic-algorithm-validation-program/details?product=19694 |
| Go crypto | [>=1.24](https://pkg.go.dev/crypto/mlkem@go1.24) | 🟡 In Progress | Go | ML-KEM | PQC roadmap at https://github.com/golang/go/issues/64537. ML-DSA planned for go [1.27](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/77626). No support for ML-KEM-512. No plan for SLH-DSA but see [go-slh-dsa](https://github.com/trailofbits/go-slh-dsa)|
| libsodium	| N/A |	🔴 Not Supported | C | None | Historically focused on well-established classical primitives and has not yet integrated native PQC algorithms into the core library |
| mbedTLS | - | 🔴 Not Started | C | None | No support, yet. Crypto API [Extension PQC 1.4](https://arm-software.github.io/psa-api/crypto/1.4/ext-pqc/) available.|
| noble cryptography | [0.6.1](https://github.com/paulmillr/noble-post-quantum/releases/tag/0.6.1) | 🟢 Ready | TypeScript / JS  | ML-KEM, ML-DSA, SLH-DSA, HSS/LMS, Falcon (Round 3) |  Support for hybids (Concrete, XWing, KitchenSink)|
| OpenSSL | [>=3.5](https://openssl-library.org/post/2025-04-08-openssl-35-final-release/) | 🟢 Ready | C | | Native support for ML-KEM-512/768/1024, ML-DSA and SLH-DSA was introduced in [OpenSSL 3.5](https://openssl.foundation/news/the-features-of-3-5-post-quantum-cryptography). Older versions require the third-party Open Quantum Safe (OQS) provider |
| PyCa/cryptography |	N/A |	🔴 Not Supported | Python | None | The standard Python cryptography package does not yet have native support. Users typically use wrappers like pyoqs or wolfcrypt-py |
| ring |	N/A |	🔴 Not Supported	| Rust |	None	| The ring crate does not support ML-KEM. Rust developers often use ml-kem (from the RustCrypto project) or aws-lc-rs for PQC support |
| wolfSSL	| >=v5.8.0  |	🟢 Ready | C | ML-KEM, ML-DSA, SLH-DSA, LMS/HSS, XMSS/XMSS^MT | Initial support for PQC was introduced in v5.0.0 using liboqs. Native PQC implementations were introduced in v5.7.0, and support for liboqs was deprecated in [February 2025](https://www.wolfssl.com/deprecation-notice-liboqs-integration/)	|
